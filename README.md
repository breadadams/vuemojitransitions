Vue web app with ~~Parcel~~ Webpack bundling.

Showcasing some of the capabilities of transitioning in Vue.js, with a few basic examples.


### Dev

To launch Webpack's bundler run the following:

```bash
### yarn
yarn build

### npm
npm run build
```

The project will be generated within the `/dist` directory.
